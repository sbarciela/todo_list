# ToDo App
  
I built the entire web app with React, based on a proposal from [#devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5). With the ToDo app you can list your pending tasks, change the state of each one between active or completed and delete one or all when they are completed. You can also filter your list based on the state of the tasks.
For a better user experience the last state of the list is saved on the  navigator session storage to be accessible each time you use the app.
